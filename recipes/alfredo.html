        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It's been called mac-n-cheese for adults.  And to us, that isn't a bad thing.  So the next time you're in the 
            mood for a hearty Italian dish, try this recipe to have an ultra thick, decadently creamy, alfredo sauce.  
            I recommend making extra, because you're going to want leftovers.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup butter</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat. Add 
                cream cheese and garlic powder, stirring with wire whisk until smooth.
                 Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps. Stir in 
                 Parmesan and pepper. Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired 
                 consistency. Sauce will thicken rapidly, thin with milk if cooked too 
                 long. Toss with hot pasta to serve.</li>
